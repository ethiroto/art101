					<h2>Challenges</h2>
					<p> We didn't have any bugs in old labs that we hadn't already fixed.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>
						I think just by trying to do the assignments without any prior debugging knowledge allowed
						for us to come up with our own techniques for debugging. I'd say the biggest learning point
						was breaking things down into smaller bits and figuring out how to isolate the issue.

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				The result of this one isn't much since we fixed all of the bugs with our previous assignments already. 
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Debugging</h2>
				We messed with the debugger tool in javascript and it seemed pretty useful.
