		<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem Solving</h1>
		<section>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The challenge of this lab is to write pseudocode that allows you to create a framework in which to work on your 
					idea breaking it down into smaller more digestable steps.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>The main issues we ran into were mainly just trying to figure out how detailed to be in our pseudocode, we didn't want 
					to get too granular, or too vague. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I thought the assignment went well, I put a lot of energy into trying to get my site 
					to work and I think it payed off. It was helpful to work it through with my partner. </p>
			</div>

				<h2>Results</h2>
				<div class="lab-results">
					<pre><code>
//Rock_Paper_Scissors
//An example of how to implement
//Ethan Christian, Aaron Rodriguez
//April 2023

//Create a continuous condition that only stops once the user quits.
	//Print the prompt “Select rock, paper or scissors”
	//Take in user input of rock, paper or scissors
		//if user input is none of these, ask for input again
	//Randomly select a number between 1 and 3
		//if the number is 1 the computer chooses rock
		//if the number is 2 the computer chooses paper
		//if the number is 3 the computer chooses scissors
	//If the user input wins over the computer input print the win condition
	//Win condition: “You won!”
	//If the user input loses over the computer input print the lose condition
		//Lose condition: “You lost”
	//If the user input ties with the computer input print the tie condition
		//Tie condition: “You tied”
	//Prompt user asking if they want to play again or quit
		//If user enters play again, then restart the loop
		//If user enters quit, then exit the loop
