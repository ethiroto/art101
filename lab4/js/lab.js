//Create a continuous condition that only stops once the user quits.
	//Print the prompt “Select rock, paper or scissors”
	//Take in user input of rock, paper or scissors
		//if user input is none of these, ask for input again
	//Randomly select a number between 1 and 3
		//if the number is 1 the computer chooses rock
		//if the number is 2 the computer chooses paper
		//if the number is 3 the computer chooses scissors
	//If the user input wins over the computer input print the win condition
	//Win condition: “You won!”
	//If the user input loses over the computer input print the lose condition
		//Lose condition: “You lost”
	//If the user input ties with the computer input print the tie condition
		//Tie condition: “You tied”
	//Prompt user asking if they want to play again or quit
		//If user enters play again, then restart the loop
		//If user enters quit, then exit the loop
