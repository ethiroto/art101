					<h2>Challenges</h2>
					<p> We ran into the challenge of figuring out how to properly call on the JSON objects 
						but after some time we worked it out and got our site to work. Additionally we had to make sure to use cors unblock.

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>
						We learned about using APIs and the types of data that can be transfered. I can see a lot of potential
						in using other people's apis to add cool stuff to our own websites. I think that this is a very useful tool.
