					<h2>Challenges</h2>
					<p> We ran into the challenge of figuring out how to write the code to get the ajax to work. 
						We also had to figure out how to get the jokes to display in the div.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>
						We learned how to use ajax and how to get the jokes to display in the div. 
						API's are very useful and we will be using them in the future.
					</p>
			</div>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				The results from this one are pretty funny. I think there is a lot more for us to learn about ajax and API's.
