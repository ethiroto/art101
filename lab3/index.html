				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The challenge of the lab was to create a file structure that allowed for ease of use.
					Additionally the challenge was to create a site with navigational links and a page like this.
				</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>I had trouble figuring out how to scale my images properly and to set limits,
					but eventually I figured it out through talking with my partner and googling. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I thought the assignment went well, I put a lot of energy into trying to get my site 
					to work and I think it payed off. It was helpful to work it through with my partner. </p>
